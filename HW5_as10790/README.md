## Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis

### 1. Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null hypothesis: The percentage of body fat lost by the test group (who did diet) is equal or lower than the percentage of body fat lost by the control group (who did exercise)

*H0: Bodyfat(diet) <= bodyfat(exercise)*

### 2. Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Null hypothesis: The proportion of adult population who trusts the president is equal or higher than the proportion of adult population who does not.

*H0: Trust >= No_trust*

### 3. Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Null hypothesis: The cessation rate of smokers who used a nicotine patch is equal or lower than the cessation rate of smokers who used a placebo patch. 

*H0: Cessation_rate(nicotine) <= cessation_rate(placebo)*

### 4. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Null hypothesis: The IQ of children born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy is equal or higher than the IQ of children born to mothers who did not smoke. 

*H0: IQ(smoking_mother) >= IQ(non-smoking_mother)*
