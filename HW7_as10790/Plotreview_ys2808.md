Hi Anastasia! This is Yuan Shi reviewing your plot. It is a really interesting topic to look at!</br>
Suggestions:</br>
1. It would be clearer with a lagend to show which color represents which race.</br>
2. From the plot it's quite hard to see a pattern. I am not sure it will work, but separate different grades would possibly make the plot easier to see the differences in races.</br>
3. It would be more conclusive if there is caption to explain your discovery.
