Assignment 1: Worked on my own mostly, discussed coding and conceptual questions with the teammates above. Helped Vishwajeet with the extra credit assignment. 

Assignment 2: Worked with my team (Akshay, Achilles, Priyanshi, Vishwajeet and Aaron) to discuss the respective comments we received from peer reviewers on the Citibike project). I helped a little bit with the structure of the write-up on Authorea, but Achilles did most of the writing. Link to the article: https://www.authorea.com/users/106123/articles/133483/_show_article


# FBB feedback
good work on the analysis in place and tests appropriately chosen and performed.
please look at the comments on the Authorea article though. Mostly the issues are issues with the linguistics organization, and wording. I recommand you read a few articles, say 1/week, from science journals like PLOSOne to understand scientific writing a bit better.
