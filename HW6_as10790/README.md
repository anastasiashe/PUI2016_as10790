Assignment 1: Worked with my team (Akshay, Achilles, Priyanshi, Vishwajeet and Aaron) to discuss the respective comments we received from peer reviewers on the Citibike project). I help a little bit with the structure of the write-up on Authorea, but Achilles did most of the writing. 
Assignment 2: Worked on my own mostly, discussed coding and conceptual questions with the teammates above.
