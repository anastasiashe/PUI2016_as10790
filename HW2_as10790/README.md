This week, for personal reasons, I could not spend much time at CUSP to work on the PUI homework in a team. I completed assignments 1 and 2 largely on my own, with some help from a non-CUSP friend who has some coding experience. I had no problems obtaining an API key from MTA and used Federica's script for reading the JSON file in Python. My friend and I then together examined the raw data, how it is structured, and read the documentation provided by MTA. I received help from my friend with writing a Python script which takes arguments and can be run in the terminal, as well as with using Pycharm editor for writing code. I was able to parse through the MTA data and complete the rest of assignments 1 and 2. 

I completed assignment 3 on my own; however I could not render a plot. The data I got had a % sign in it and I receive the following error: Empty 'DataFrame': no numeric data to plot.
