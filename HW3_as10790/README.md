After I worked on my own to complete Assignment 1 of HW3 I asked my classmate Vish to take a look at the scatter plots and histogram I created to confirm I did everything correctly- 

On Assignment 2 I worked with the following classmates: Aaron, Akshay, Vish, Achilles and Pryianshi. We formulated the null and alternative hypothesis together as a team, downloaded and parsed the data.
