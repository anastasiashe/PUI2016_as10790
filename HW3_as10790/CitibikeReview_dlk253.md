Hi Anastasia,


a. 
It looks like your hypothesis and null hypothesis are clearly formulated. Please see my comments below--
This is your hypothesis 
"Idea: Citi Bike customers (users who purchase 24-hour or 7-day passes) tend to take longer trips on average than Citi Bike subscribers 
(users who purchase annual membership)"
dlk253 comments: I am not sure why the word idea is included, but I see that this is the hypothesis. I would suggest taking out idea.
This is a clearly forumlated hypothesis. 

This is your null hypotheses
Null hypothesis: Mean trip duration of user type "customers" is less than the mean trip duration of user type "subscribers," 
significance level (alpha) = 0.05

b. Yes, the data supports the project. You succesfully dropped the columns and were left with the appropriate values to run the test. 
Bonus! I like that you converted the trip duration from seconds to minutes. The plot of the Average trip length by user type is successful.
It does leave me with more questinos -- What day of the week are these durations hightest/lowest? What hours of the day are the durations hightest
and lowest? Is there a moment in the data where the subscriber (in the hours or days) is actaully higher than the customer? This first
data set opens up opportunites to lead to much more. 

c. For H0 you could use the t-Test, it looks for differences between two groups on some variable of interest you have two groups:
Do subscribers and customers differ in the amount of minutes they spend commuting in a given (month, day, year, time of day, holiday) or 
you could even use (the commute between two locations - are the subscirbers faster thatn the customers?)


Alternative hypothesis: Mean trip duration of user type "customers" is greater than the mean trip duration of user type "subscribers"
I think a speed one would be fun to calculate.
